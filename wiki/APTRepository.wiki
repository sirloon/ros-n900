ros-n900 download files section can act as an APT repository. This is helpful to easily install ROS on N900 mobile phone. In order to do such, you'll need to install a new source from your N900.

 * login to your phone
 * edit `/etc/apt/sources.list` and add the following line:

{{{
deb http://ros-n900.googlecode.com/files /
}}}

 * run `apt-get update`
 * then install ROS, running `apt-get install ros-boxturtle-base`

(careful, this is a huge download, you should use a Wifi connection to preserve your dataplan).

`ros-boxturtle-base` package is optified, this means it will install in `/opt/ros-boxturtle-base/` directory, in `/opt` partition (2GB) instead of rootfs (256MB).
